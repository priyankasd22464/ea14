    <h2 class="test">What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol>
        
        <li class="test1">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li class="test1">CSS descries how HTML elements are to be displayed  on screen ,paper,or in other media.</li>
        <li class="test1"> <span class="sp lt" >  CSS is not necessary  </span> <b class="sp">CSS saves a lot of work</b> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at Once </li>
        <li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="test">CSS can be added to HTML do HTML document in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="test1" > <span class="test2">
        Inline - by using style attribute inside HTML elements </span></li>
        <li class="test1"> <span class="test2">  Internal - by using style element in the head section </span> </li>
        <li class="test1"> <span class ="test2"> External- by using a link element to link to an external CSS file. However ,<b class="sp"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</b> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier
        for you to try it yourself.</span></li> </ul> 

        <p class="test1"> When compairing CSS class vs ID , the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements ID ,
            on the other hand ,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to 
            link dirctly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p class="test1">
            In CSS ,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.
            Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of style or set of styles can be applied to the element.

        </p>
        <p class="test1">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID .Both are used to targete
            element to which a style should be applied.
